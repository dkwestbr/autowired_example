This was my first exposure to Spring and I thought it could be helpful for others. Basically, this demonstrates a very basic use of Spring's @Autowired annotation. In addition, this project contains no xml config files and is configured purely through Spring/Jersey annotations.

This was originally created when I was first playing with Spring and ran into this problem: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19302445/unable-to-get-autowired-to-work-or-do-a-component-scan

I hope it helps you out!
