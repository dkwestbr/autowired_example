This is a little diddle I made to figure out how to implement an @Autowired solution web app.  The tech stack for this project is Spring/Jersey/Tomcat.  This works and should serve as a good example or starting point if you're interested in the same or a similar stack for your own project.

This was originally created when I was first playing with Spring and ran into this problem: http://stackoverflow.com/questions/19302445/unable-to-get-autowired-to-work-or-do-a-component-scan

I hope it helps you out!
